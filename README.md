## Welcome !

I am a first-generation college graduate from the University of California, Riverside with a BA in Studio Art and BA in Sociology. I am not fond of the idea of being boxed into one set path; rather, I seek to maintain active in all my interests. I continuously seek to learn and implement new methods into my quantitative and qualitative skills and interests in research and the arts. As a highly motivated individual and self-starter, I have laid the foundation of an intersectional identities research project. Through my culminated experiences in relation to data, I have gained skills in Softwares such as SPSS, ATLAS.ti, Python, SQL, and survey design.

In relation to my passions, but outside of my work life, you will find me at art openings in NYC and LA, watching experimental films, reading the latest and greatest philosophy and vernacular literature, or building my next wood sculpture. I am currently developing skills in C++, Java, and wood working with vinyl sheets. Feel free to message me via my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-rodriguez-trujillo-b98688167/) to get a sneak peak into my arts and data science background !
